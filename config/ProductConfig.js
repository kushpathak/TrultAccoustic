        description:
          "GRG121DX ELECTRIC GUITAR Like every genre, Heavy Metal music has its traditions. Drop tuned power chords, screaming solos and plenty of distortion. The GRG121DX is to handle even the heaviest of riffs with great mid range tone to help you cut through the mix. Over three decades the RG has been a heavy hitter in the world of metal with a modern design, great playability and amazing they're a great choice for any budding shredder. Great Mid Range Tone The rosewood fretboard takes a little edge off of the tone, especially useful with fresh strings, rounding out the top end and giving you a warmer sound. The mahogany body produces a punchy growl with a good sustain which makes it for heavy rock with good low frequencies, a tendency to the lower mids, and a smooth but relatively subdued higher end. You don't have to worry about getting lost in the mix, this guitar has plenty of mid-range muscle to help you cut through. Solid setup A fixed bridge gives you better sustain (great for soloing) and helps stop you going out of tune. When you're using drop tunings a floating bridge needs adjusting to keep the string tension right, fixed bridges don't need so much attention, great if you want to switch between tunings quickly. Built for speed for heavy rock and metal solos you need to be able to quickly and comfortably reach the top frets. Necks are flat, thin and very fast, just right for quick shredding. The deep cutaways give you great access to the upper frets so you get a better range for soloing and a flat fretboard that's great for string bending. Specifications: neck type GRG Maple neck body Mahogany body fretboard Bound Rosewood fretboard w/Sharktooth inlay fret Jumbo frets bridge Fixed bridge neck pickup IBZ-6 (H) neck pickup (Passive/Ceramic) bridge pickup IBZ-6 (H) bridge pickup (Passive/Ceramic).",
